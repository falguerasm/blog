            <p>The work of Paris-based photographer Ludovic Balay spans fashion, still life, travel, interior design, and more. Beautifully lit and styled, his compelling visual tales are aesthetically pleasing records of everyday life—carefully shot through a dreamy lens of vivid colors and engagements with natural light hoping to lend ordinariness a new aesthetic dimension and meaning.</p>
            <p>Finding his love for photography wasn’t accidental for Ludovic. The Brittany-born creative had always inclined to the subject, but only embraced it as his calling during college, which prompted him to enrol at ENS Louis-Lumière, the pioneering French school for the cinema and photography industry. Today, his decision to pursue his passion has proven to be the right one. At the mere age of twenty-five, his striking work has captured the attention of notable publications of the likes of Conde Nast Traveller and The New York Times T Magazine, as well as international luxury fashion houses such as Chanel and Courréges.</p>
            <p>“My work is united in its preference for vivid, nuanced colors and minimal, natural settings”</p>
            <p>Ludovic’s longstanding fascination and appreciation for architecture and design has resulted in an incredible, finely tuned eye for details and colors, with always original, often unpredictable, outcomes. His curiosity knows no bounds, and inspiration reveals itself at every turn—his constant imagination making it difficult to categorize his work in any known photography category. “While my sources of inspiration are varied, my work is united in its preference for vivid, nuanced colors and minimal, natural settings,” he explains to IGNANT.</p>
